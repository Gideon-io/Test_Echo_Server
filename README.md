# Test_Echo_Server
Practice for async and interaction with web sockets

Utilises Tokio.

A simple echo server, where the client send a message to server 2. Server 2 then sends the message to server 1 and returns it back to server 2. Finally, server 2 sends it back to the client. Its very simple and just used to familiarise myself with web sockets and aysnc.
